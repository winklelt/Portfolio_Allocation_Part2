The Excel file “lecture6p 2022.xlsx” contains daily market data for Microsoft, Intel,
Southwest, McDonald’s, and Johnson & Johnson from 12/29/1989 to 8/31/2022, obtained
from Yahoo Finance. The file also includes a daily risk-free rate time series from Kenneth
French’s Data Library. For this problem set, you should calculate time series of weekly
returns.

1. Construct weekly simple total returns from the price data (use Adj Close to include
dividends). Compute and report the weekly and annual mean and standard deviation
for each stock. Compute the correlation matrix.

3. Construct the mean-variance frontier for the Intel-Microsoft combination. Indicate the
minimum-variance portfolio and the efficient frontier (the efficient frontier is a set of
expected returns - risks that you would want to consider investing in).

5. Add remaining stocks to the mix. Compute the mean-variance frontier and plot it
on the same chart with the one from the previous question. Indicate the minimumvariance
portfolio and the efficient frontier. How do they compare to those of the
previous question?

7. Add the riskless asset and construct the tangent portfolio for the Intel-Microsoft case.
Next, construct the tangent portfolio for the full set of stocks. Compare the Sharpe
ratios of the two tangent portfolios.

9. Assume your risk aversion is A = 3.5. What is your optimal mix of assets (including
the risk-free asset)?
